ğŸ§© Problem Statement: Trapping Rain Water
You are given an array height[] of non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a block, and the width of each block is 1.

Imagine this array as a bar chart where the width of each bar is 1. Compute how much water can be trapped between the bars after raining.

ğŸ§® Example:
Input:


height = {4, 2, 0, 6, 3, 2, 5}
Output:
11
Explanation:

Water is trapped in valleys between the bars.

Total trapped water = 11 units.

ğŸ“¥ Input:
An integer array height[] of size n
0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

n >= 1

ğŸ“¤ Output:
Return a single integer: total units of rain water that can be trapped.

âœ… Constraints:
1 <= height.length <= 10^5

0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

ğŸ’¡ Follow-Up:
Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
(Hint: Two-pointer approach)
